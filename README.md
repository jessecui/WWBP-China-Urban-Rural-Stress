# Hierarchical Linear Models (HLMs) to Measure Urban-Rural Stress Expressions Differences in China


We use HLMs to measure urban/rural differences in stress expressions in China after text-mining from Weibo posts that discuss stress. HLMs allow us to model the contribution of regional characteristics on individuals language. 

The description of the data and model is part of our paper published at AAAI ICWSM 2022. 

Preprint: (TBD)

## Directory Structure
* `Supplementary_Materials.pdf`: This file contains the supplementary materials for our paper.
* `/county_level_main`: This directory contains data and code to run the main county-level HLM. 
* `/county_level_post_stratified`: This directory contains the data and code to run the HLM on the county-level with post-stratified weights on gender.
* `/province_level`: This directory contains data and code to run HLM on the province-level
* `/reference_data`: This directory contains files to view reference data, such as the words in each LDA topic, LIWC categories, frequency occurrenecs of phrases, and province gender ratios used to calculate post-stratified weights.

## Usage
Each directory with HLM scripts should have a corresponding bash file to run to retrieve correlations from the HLM model. These results are also already included in the repo in the `/script_results` folder for each directory that includes a script. Raw data is in the `/data` folder and the HLM code itself is in a corresponding `hlm_model.R` file.

Run the bash script as follows to run HLM:

`bash run_hlm.bash`
